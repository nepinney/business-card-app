# eCards - Digital Business Cards App

## Introduction

Business cards have always been on paper and this app focuses on changing this. Using react native, this app provides users with features to digitally create and share information in a familiar 'business card style' format. To create a card users can upload a picture of an exciting card or with pre-made templates users can choose which information they want to include on the card and in which configuration it will appear and simply fill it in. With created cards, users can then upload it to the apple/google wallet and easily show or share to other deivces.
